Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the Citi Bike rider data in New York City to gain valuable insights into who our primary customers are. We'll use this information to create a preliminary analysis for when we implement the same service in Des Moines.

Checkout Times for Users

By looking at the chart below, we see that the vast majority of bike users rent their bike for less than an hour, with the greatest amount of users renting for only 0-30 minutes. This means that most customers are only using the bikes for a very short period, and might be using them to cross short distances in the congested neighborhoods of NYC. Thus we should adjust our business strategy accordingly, allowing users to quickly check out a bike, and facilitating multiple rentals per day.

Checkout Times by Gender

In the chart below, we see that men represent a far greater share of the customer base than women, while the duration of the rental is similar between both sexes. For comparison, for rides lasting 5 minutes, the amount of male users was 108,087 whereas the amount of female users was 33,041, while users of an unknown sex constituted 5,624 riders. This means that men are more than 3x as likely to rent a bike, and in theory would form the bulk of our customer base. However, I find it very unusual that there's such a huge gender gap, and would like to explore this further to understand if there's some cultural dynamic or other factor responsible.

Trips by Weekday

In the heatmap below, we can examine the average bike usage by hour and day of the week. We can see two trends emerging from the data. One, the majority of rides during the weekdays are concentrated from 5 AM to 9 AM, and even more so from 4 PM to 8 PM. If we believe that users are renting bikes in order to commute, then it would make sense that the majority of rides are concentrated around these hours as they follow a traditional 9 to 5 work schedule. Also, note that the number of rides is more evenly spread out on Friday. This may be due to workers leaving their jobs early to take advantage of the weekend.

Second, from 8 AM to 8 PM on Saturday and Sunday there
